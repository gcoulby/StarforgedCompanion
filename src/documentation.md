## Introduction

### What is Ironsworn?

Ironsworn is a tabletop RPG created by Shawn Tomkin. What makes Ironsworn unique is that unlike traditional tabletop RPGs, Ironsworn enables solo/ small-group play, as its unique game mechanics remove the need for a traditional game master. 

What is even more fascinating about Ironsworn is the distribution methods. When reading the game, you realise the care, effort and devotion that has gone in to creating this game and yet, the game is released as open-source under the creative commons 4.0 [![License: CC BY 4.0](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/bca967b18143b8a5b2ffe78bd4a1a30f6bc21de83bd8336f748e96498af38b38/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f4c6963656e73652d43432532304259253230342e302d6c69676874677265792e737667)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

Ironsworn truly is a labour of love and is available for free at https://www.ironswornrpg.com/ 

### What is the Ironsworn Companion?

First and foremost, this application is not an official Ironsworn product, instead it leverages the CC4.0 license to provide a digital toolkit for playing the game.

I used to use platforms such as Roll20 for playing campaigns with a remote group of friends. I wanted a similar experience from Ironsworn, e.g. a digital companion app that could aid, automate and track my game to reduce on paper waste and also provide quick and easy ways to exploit mechanics such as `The Oracle` *(a roll-based game mechanic to spark ideas during game play).*

While there are various companions out there, I was disappointed with the features and felt they didn't match my view of what the companion should be like. That's not to say the other apps are bad, but many just felt like lightweight tools to support pen and paper play, which is great, if that is what you want.

This app is not designed to replace the rules, though it may clear your desk of progress tracks and asset cards. 



## Using the app

### Oracles

Before discussing the features of the app its important to understand how the oracle works. Throughout the companion you will see the following roll icon in various places:

This icon denotes that you can consult the oracle. Each implementation of the oracle differs between pages. For example, by consulting the oracle during character creation a random Ironlander name will be generated; whereas, by consulting the oracle during world creation a number of world truths will be defined. As with everything in Ironsworn, if the Oracle's insights are not inline with your version of Ironlands or provides some contradiction, you can either roll again or carve your own path. You should definitely consult the rules on how exactly to use the Oracle, this app merely takes away the need to cross reference a comprehensive list of roll tables.
